'''
You are given a set S of integers between -30000 and 30000 (inclusive).

Find the total number of sextuples(a,b,c,d,e,f)
that statisfy
	(a*b+c)/d -e = f

Input
The first line contains integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), the size of a set S.

Elements of S are given in the next N lines, one integer per line. Given numbers will be distinct.

Output
Output the total number of plausible sextuples.
